# Cambridge Hubway Data Analysis

A look at how Hubway is used in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Read more about it here: https://medium.com/p/b80d1a8bb0cf/.

## How to Use

If you want to replicate my findings or otherwise explore the data on your own, you'll need to have python (version 3), numpy, pandas, ggplot, jupyter, and mapboxgl installed on your machine. You will also need to unzip some of the data files in the `camb-hubway-data` directory, these needed to be zipped because of their large size. Then run `jupyter notebook` inside this directory.
